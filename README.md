I like collecting movie posters and logging films on [my Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/gumdad/).

This script will aggregate movie posters for sale and cross-reference it with provided Letterboxd list URLs.

# usage
`npm run search`

Entering this URL would search for posters that I've "liked", sorted in descending order by rating:
